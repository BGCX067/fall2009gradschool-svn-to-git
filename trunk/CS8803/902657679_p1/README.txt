---------------------
COMPILING AND RUNNING
---------------------

Please extract the .zip archive if not done so already.

Next, open the .vcproj file using Visual Studio 2008.

In main.cpp, there is a section of constants to file paths.

Please change these to the paths of the corresponding files extracted from the
	.zip.  This will ensure that facts, events, and operators are loaded
	correctly.
	
Now, Visual Studio 2008 should be able to compile and run the code correctly.

Please contact ken.a.hartsook@gmail.com if you have any questions.
