Description of Grammar for EBNF:
    
I adheared to the guidelines on the project for my grammar, except
that I named a few things a little bit differently. My EBNF grammar is as follows:

BNFDESCRIPTION    -> DEFINITION BNFDESCRIPTION* .
DEFINITION        -> NONTERMINAL '->' EXPRESSION .
EXPRESSION        -> SEQUENCE | SEQUENCE '|' RIGHTHANDSIDE | .
SEQUENCE          -> TERM [SEQUENCE] .
TERM              -> NONTERMINAL | STRING | '['expression']' | '('expression')' | terminal+ | terminal* .
NONTERMINAL       -> characters .
STRING            -> 'characters' | "characters" .

My regular expressions are readabble in my lex file, 
and my ebnf.ebnf which is similar to the above is one of my test cases.

My ebnf grammar in ebnf is ebnf.ebnf.
My bf grammar in bnf is bnf.ebnf.

My test files are bnf.ebnf, ebnf.ebnf, test.txt and meta.txt and the output files are bnf.ebnf.output, ebnf.ebnf.output, test.txt.output, and meta.txt.output respectively.
